Chatzy is a simple chatting system built using Socket.io. It consists of both frontend and backend components.

## Frontend (FE)

The frontend is responsible for the user interface of the chatting system.

### Installation

```
cd FE/
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the development server for the frontend. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to access the application.

## Backend (BE)

The backend provides the server-side functionality for managing connections and handling messages in the chatting system.

### Installation

```cd BE/
npm install
npm run dev```

This will start the development server for the backend. The server will be running on port 5000 by default.
